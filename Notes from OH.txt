Notes from Charli's OH on EC2B1 group project 

General outline of the essay: 
- Introduction of India's growth 
--- Could come up with some explanation on why it is interesting to study India's economy
--- What are some existing, contrasting beliefs on the cause of India's growth
- Growth accounting 
- Solow model 
- Romer model
- Additional factors (e.g. institutional, cultural) 


[3rd Feb 2025]
> Savings - share of investment variable, does it include foreign investment
- Depreciation rate
- Consumption share output from PennTable --> 1 - consumption 
- Explain its limitation and proxy 

> Qualitative predictions from the model - make some conclusions & interpretations 
- Solow model
-- 1. Gy = GA, constant - constant in the real world? e.g. US - 2% per year 
-- 2. Further from steady-state -> higher growth, in which year is India definitely not in their steady-state? 
-- 3. Convergence, poor countries + low growth rate -- inconsistent 
- Romer model 
-- 1. Population growth & GDP growth 

> General 
- Have all the models in the code but only include the best-fit in the essay, with explanation of the process 
-- Include the equation of our model in the essay, explain which trend we use 

- Use GDP per capita (especially if there is no big changes in labour participation rate, so GDP growth is due to actual output growth and not population growth 

- Growth rate calculation - using (2) log difference or (1) the actual change/original calculation 
-- From class, (2) is known to be an approximation for (1), but we should not think of it this way 
-- (2) is equally valid, with different properties and it is also a more elegant method 

- (?) Calculating TFP, compare with % in R&D or other proxy, to conclude if it's exogenous

> Trend specification 
- Linear, quadratic, loglinear log quadratic
- Plot it against logy, more common to do logy
- If none of them fit, do it subperiod 

- Levels might fit better for some countries, include in the robustness check
- For essay, show the one that fits better 

> Growth accounting 
- When we observe -ve contribution for growth accounting - explain why it is this way, maybe there wasn't any growth in GDP
-- We could do the growth accounting over a longer period, expand the time period
-- If we still have negative or big numbers, explain, split the periods 

- Time periods for growth accounting, don't do it on year on year, 
-- Based on logical sub period, don't need to be the same length 
-- For example, before the recession, and the recovery
-- Possible split: by the GDP growth or by their contribution 

> Explain by Solow model, qualitative predictions of the model and explain how well 
- E.g. for poorer countries with low growth rates, then the Solow model doesn't explain 
- Can't really calculate and prove the Solow model 
- Find out the main arguments of the Solow model 
- (Same for Romer, main argument of rls about pop growth and economic growth, period with high population growth, also has high technological growth?, share of researchers) 
- E.g. (Japan and Germany, fit for Solow model, large destruction after WWII, definitely not in a steady state) 

> General notes: 
- Don't do the essay as a Q&A, but also make the structure obvious for the marker to know where to find the answers 
- Additive growth, Phillipon paper on log linear, linear linear trend. Human capital, Mankiw, Roweir and Weil, 1992.
