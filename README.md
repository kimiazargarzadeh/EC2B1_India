# **India’s GDP Growth Analysis: A Data-Driven Approach**

## **Overview**

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that performs a comprehensive **analysis of India’s GDP growth from 1950 to 2019**. The analysis explores India’s economic trajectory through three distinct sub-periods: 1950-1979, 1979-1991, and 1991-2019. The notebook utilizes data-driven techniques to examine GDP trends, growth models, and key performance indicators (KPIs) during each period.

The main goal is to explore the key drivers of India’s growth through the lens of well-known economic models such as the **Solow model** (capital-driven growth), the impact of **policy failures** and **reforms**, and the transition to **productivity-led growth** in the post-1991 era.

## **Abstract**

India has experienced significant economic growth, transforming into one of the world’s leading economies. This analysis examines India’s growth from 1950 to 2019 through the lens of economic growth literature, focusing on three key sub-periods:

- **1950 to 1979**: Capital accumulation drove moderate GDP growth, largely explained by the **Solow model**.
- **1979 to 1991**: Marked by inconsistent growth, this period reflects **pre-reform struggles** and inefficiencies.
- **1991 to 2019**: This period represents India’s turning point, where the **Romer model** captures the economic takeoff fueled by **innovation** and **productivity gains**.

These findings highlight the interplay of growth models and institutions in shaping India’s economic trajectory, emphasizing the complexity of its development.

## **Technologies and Tools Used**

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for data analysis and manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data handling and preprocessing.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization (charts and graphs).
- **SQL**: Used to query and extract data from financial databases (if applicable).
- **Excel/CSV**: Data sources used for analysis.


### **Prerequisites**
To run the notebook, you will need the following:

- **Python 3.x** (preferably version 3.7 or later)
- **Jupyter Notebook** or **JupyterLab**
- Libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
