# India's GDP growth analysis
# India has experienced significant economic growth, transforming into one of the world’s leading economies. This paper examines India’s growth from 1950 to 2019 through the lens of economic growth literature, focusing on three key sub-periods. From 1950 to 1979, capital accumulation drove moderate GDP growth, largely explained by the Solow model. The 1979 to 1997 period, marked by inconsistent growth, reflects pre-reform struggles. Finally, 1991 to 2019 represents India’s turning point, where the Romer model captures the economic takeoff fueled by innovation and productivity gains. These findings highlight the interplay of growth models and institutions in shaping India’s economic trajectory, emphasizing the complexity of its development.
